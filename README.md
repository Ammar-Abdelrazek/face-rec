Class Attendance System Using Face Recognition
The aim of this project is to design and develop a Class Attendance System based on face recognition technology. Traditional methods of taking attendance in classrooms are time-consuming and prone to errors. Leveraging the capabilities of facial recognition algorithms, this system offers a reliable, efficient, and automated solution for managing class attendance.

The face recognition algorithm utilizes machine learning techniques to extract unique facial features from the captured images and matches them against a pre-registered database of studentâ€™s faces. By comparing the detected faces with the database, the system can accurately identify students in real-time and mark their attendance automatically.

how to use it:
the folder of the projcet should contain the folder "imagesAttendance" which will be the database for students, "Attendance,csv" in which the reak-time student attendance will automaticly be recorded.
